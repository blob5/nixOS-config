# 🌟 blob's NixOS Configuration

A modular, customizable NixOS configuration using Flakes that features multiple hosts and window managers.

#### ⚠️ Warning
This setup is modular but still tailored to my personal environment. While I don't recommend using it directly as a plug-and-play solution, you're welcome to copy and adapt specific parts that suit your needs.
